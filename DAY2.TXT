 Problem Number: 242. Valid Anagram

 Definition:

Given two strings s and t, return True if t is an anagram of s, otherwise return **False`.
An anagram means both strings contain the same characters with the same frequency, but possibly in a different order.

How to Solve (5–10 lines explanation):

First, check if the lengths of s and t are equal. If not → return False.

Count the frequency of each character in both strings.

Compare the counts — if they match, return True.

In Python, we can use a dictionary (hashmap) to store counts.

Alternatively, Python provides collections.Counter which makes counting easy.

Sorting is another way: if sorted s == sorted t, they are anagrams.

Best approach is using a hashmap for O(n) time efficiency.
