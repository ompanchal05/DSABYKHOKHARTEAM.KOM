Day 4 – Group Anagrams (DSA with Python)

Problem:
Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. 
Return the groups in any order.

Definition:
Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters, regardless of order.

Example:
Input: ["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]
Output: [["hat"],["act","cat"],["stop","pots","tops"]]

Approach:
Use a dictionary where:
- Key  = sorted version of the string (same for all anagrams)
- Value = list of anagrams with that signature

Algorithm:
1. Create an empty dictionary anagram_map.
2. Loop through each string.
3. Sort the characters to form a key.
4. Append string to that key’s list.
5. Return all values of dictionary.

Time Complexity:
O(n * k log k)
n = number of strings
k = average length of each string

Space Complexity:
O(n * k) for storing grouped anagrams
